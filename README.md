> DEPRECATED: project is outdated and doesn't maintain for a while. Alternatives:
> - If you interested in gonzales, take a look at [gonzales-pe](https://github.com/tonyganch/gonzales-pe), this is a fork of gonzales with post processors support (sass, less) and other improvements.
> - We also recommend looking at [CSSTree](https://github.com/csstree/csstree), which began as refactoring of gonzales, but later became a brand new solution for parsing and processing CSS.
